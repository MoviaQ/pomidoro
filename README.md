# Pomidoro: The Game

Hello! We’re excited to introduce you to our project—Pomidoro!

## What is Pomidoro?

### The Concept
In Pomidoro, your mission is to grow various plants—from tomatoes and cucumbers to bananas and oranges! But how do the plants grow? By working! When you set a timer based on the Pomodoro technique, your plants will thrive as you focus.

The Pomodoro technique revolves around 25-minute work sessions, followed by 5-minute breaks. During these short breaks, you'll get the chance to harvest your crops! At the end of your workday, you can sell the crops, earn money, and reinvest in more plants. The more plants you have, the more crops you can sell... and voilà, you're part of the great cycle of plant-growing capitalism!

### The Name
The name Pomidoro is a playful fusion of two words: "pomodoro" (from the Pomodoro technique) and "pomidor," which means "tomato" in Polish.

### Our Mission

Our aim is to create an app that helps increase focus and productivity by adding a little fun to your daily routine. We want to turn your workday into something more engaging while keeping it simple and free for everyone to enjoy.

But beyond that, we just wanted to work on something fun and creative—and Pomidoro is our answer to making life’s mundane moments a bit more entertaining!
